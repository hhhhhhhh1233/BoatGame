# Boat Game Overview

This is an early version of a game that I intend to be a boat metroidvania for the [playdate](https://play.date) console. Using the playdate's crank to change the water level and abilities you find along the way you explore a water world to collect research samples of the local fauna and whatever else you might stumble upon.
