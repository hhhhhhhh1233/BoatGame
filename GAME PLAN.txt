GAME PLAN

Expand the intro to add a part where on your way to the planet something happens to your ship and it crashes and you fall out and end up in a watery cave. Your goal is then to get back to your ship with enough samples then fly back home.

Add an ending sequence where you have to escape a large enemy that moves slowly but can't be killed, this will end when you reach your ship and fly off. Then present the player with a screen that shows what percentage of samples they collected and how long they took to encourage optimal runs.

Sample Viewer
Create a menu where the player can peruse the samples they collected plus a little blurb about them.
Allow the player to view the whole sprite again, but also make a little icon for the menu.

Remove the Upgrader and co. and replace them with creatures that say nothing.
Maybe leave the upgrader for the very end of the game or something.

Make it take a while before the player gets the water wheel so it feels like an upgrade and not something you just start with.
But since without it you can only move left and right, also add in some environmental objects that affects the water level that the player can interact with.
Like a waterfall to increase water level, or maybe like a drooling frog, then something to decrease the water level like something that you could make drink it or soak it into something.
